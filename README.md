# Project1
CPSC8985 Graduate Seminar Project

The project creates a simple application which allows the user to enter a set off data attributes. 
It connects the Java application to MySQL database.  

In theory the application should have the ability to be leverage by various business functions in order to make decisions.
For example, a production scheduler should be able to utilize the system to determine how many cases to produce per shift per product.

If any have any suggestions on how to improve on this project.  The help would be appreciated.
